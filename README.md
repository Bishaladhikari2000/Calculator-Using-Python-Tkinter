# Calculator-Using-Python-Tkinter
This is my first python project where I have used Python and Tkinter for GUI features.

What is Tkinter?
Tkinter is a Python library that provides an easy way to access the Tk GUI toolkit. It is Python's de facto standard GUI and the primary Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit.

This is basically the calculator I made.

There are some problems like:

1) I couldn't add backspace button.
2) It doesn't show error message.
